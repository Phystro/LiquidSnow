# Introduction

There are several extensions to various classes provided by Core. They are therefore divided into the general namespaces within which they fall This also makes it easy to use them without cluttering your code, as they only become available once you refer to a library that they target. Currently, there are:
1. Global Extensions- these are extensions that do not fall into any specific namespace.
2. Generic Extensions - These are extensions for the `System.Collections.Generic` namespace
3. ObjectModel Extensions - Are extensions for `System.Collections.ObjectModel` namespace
4. IO Extensions - are extensions targeting `System.IO` namespace.
